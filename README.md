# Character-Generator

Data Structures


This was my final project for data structures. It is a very simple DnD character generator. 
The user is limited to just a small selection of races, classes, and backgrounds because I had to gather that information by hand.
I utilize hash tables in this program, but frankly this is from my baby programmer days so there are imperfections and inefficiencies in my code.
